# Food Delivery System
In the midst of the Coronavirus outbreak, the University of Wisconsin-Madison decided to use Starship robots, who deliver food to students. I made an application that helps manage food delivery orders utilizing a PriorityQueue (utilizing the Heap data structure). The program takes the distance between students and the robots to determine the quickest route to deliver the food. I learned how to deal with queues, as well as gained practice with heap data structures.

This was a project for the CS 300: Programming II course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
